## Batteries

A lithium polymer battery, or more correctly, lithium-ion polymer battery (abbreviated as LiPo, LIP, Li-poly, lithium-poly, and others), is a rechargeable battery derived from lithium-ion and lithium-metal battery technology. The primary difference is that instead of using a liquid lithium salt (such as lithium hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6) held in an organic solvent (such as EC/DMC/DEC) as the electrolyte, the battery uses a solid (or semi-solid) polymer electrolyte such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF). Other terms used in the literature for this system include hybrid polymer electrolyte (HPE), where "hybrid" denotes the combination of the polymer matrix, the liquid solvent, and the salt.

Polymer electrolytes can be divided into two large categories: dry solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) and gel polymer electrolytes (GPE).

In comparison to liquid electrolytes and solid organic electrolytes, polymer electrolytes offer advantages such as increased resistance to variations in the volume of the electrodes throughout the charge and discharge processes, improved safety features, excellent flexibility, and processability. These batteries provide higher specific energy than other lithium battery types.

They are used in applications where weight is critical, such as laptop computers, tablets, smartphones, radio-controlled aircraft, and some electric vehicles.

Like other lithium-ion cells, LiPos operate based on the intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium ions between a positive and a negative electrode. However, instead of a liquid electrolyte, LiPos typically use a gelled or solid polymer-based electrolyte as the conductive medium. A microporous polymer separator is used to prevent direct contact between the electrodes, while still allowing lithium-ion transport.

A typical cell has four main components: a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator, and an electrolyte. The separator itself may be a polymer, such as a microporous film of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP); thus, even when the cell has a liquid electrolyte, it will still contain a "polymer" component. In addition to this, the positive electrode can be further divided into three parts: the lithium-transition-metal-oxide (such as LiCoO2 or LiMn2O4), a conductive additive, and a polymer binder of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF). The negative electrode material may have the same three parts, only with carbon replacing the lithium-metal-oxide. The main difference between lithium-ion polymer cells and lithium-ion cells is the physical phase of the electrolyte, such that LiPo cells use dry solid, gel-like electrolytes, whereas Li-ion cells use liquid electrolytes.
